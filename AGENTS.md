# Agent Instructions

## Project management with Kanbus

Use Kanbus for task management.
Why: Kanbus task management is MANDATORY here; every task must live in Kanbus.
When: Create/update the Kanbus task before coding; close it only after the change lands.
How: See CONTRIBUTING_AGENT.md for the Kanbus workflow, hierarchy, status rules, priorities, command examples, and the mistakes to avoid. Never inspect project/ or issue JSON directly (including with cat or jq); use Kanbus commands only.
Performance: Prefer kbs (Rust) when available; kanbus (Python) is equivalent but slower.
Warning: Editing project/ directly violates The Way. Do not read or write anything in project/; work only through Kanbus.
Git / PR policy: Rules for product-code commits, branch names, pull requests, and human approval live in this repository's AGENTS.md (outside this Kanbus section). CONTRIBUTING_AGENT.md covers Kanbus board mechanics such as `kbs commit`; follow AGENTS.md for product code and git workflow.

## Git

This repository is its own git repo. Do not commit Limatus into the parent
`~/Projects` checkout.

`develop` is the continuous-integration branch. Merge accepted, green work
there as soon as it is ready. Do not park completed work on long-lived
feature branches waiting for `main`.

`main` is the release branch. Semantic-release runs only from `main`.
Do not treat a merge to `develop` as a production release. The release
workflow is local to this repo and authenticates with `GITHUB_TOKEN`;
do not call the platform-ci reusable workflow, which requires an
`anthusbot_gh_token` this repository does not have.

Open pull requests against `develop`. Merge them there as soon as
sub-agent review is addressed and CI is green. Do not park completed
work on feature branches. Promote `develop` to `main` when you intend a
release, not as the daily integration path.
